        <h2>What is a Programming Language?</h2>
        <p>A programming language is a set of instructions that enables humans to communicate with computersâ€”using a series of symbols that serve as a bridge that allows humans to turn our ideas into instructions computers can understand. Like spoken languages, each language has its own unique syntax, structure, vocabulary, and even slang or shortcuts.</p>
        <h3>Examples of Programming Languages</h3>
        <div class="examples">
            <div class="example">
                <img src="images/python.png" alt="Python">
                <p><strong>Python</strong></p>
                <p>Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language. It is often used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="example">
                <img src="images/java.png" alt="Java">
                <p><strong>Java</strong></p>
                <p>Java is an object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere".</p>
            </div>
            <div class="example">
                <img src="images/javascript.png" alt="JavaScript">
                <p><strong>JavaScript</strong></p>
                <p>JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, and interpreted programming language. It is commonly used for client-side scripting on the web, allowing developers to add interactivity to web pages.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="example">
                <img src="images/csharp.png" alt="C#">
                <p><strong>C#</strong></p>
                <p>C# is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft. It's widely used for developing desktop applications, web applications, and games, particularly with the Unity game engine.</p>
